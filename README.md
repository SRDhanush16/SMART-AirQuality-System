## About MQ2 gas sensor

The MQ-2 gas sensor is a widely used electronic device designed to detect various gases in the air. 
It is particularly sensitive to combustible gases like **methane, butane, propane, and alcohol vapors**.
But the Library for the MQ2 gas sensor is only programmed for detecting **LPG , CO (Carbon Monooxide) and SMOKE**.
