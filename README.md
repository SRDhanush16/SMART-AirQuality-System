# SMART-AirQuality-System

airqualitycode.ino has the code/ 
The code is written in Arduino Programming language a subset of C++ 

Libraries directory contains 2 libraries that will be used in the code 
* MQ2-sensor-library-Master (**NECESSARY**) 
* Arduino-Liquid-Crystal-I2C-Library-Master 

## Materails Required

1) Arduino UNO 
2) USB 2.0 Cable Type A/B. 
3) Male to female / male to  male Wires 
4) MQ2 Gas sensor 
5) 16x2 LCD (**NOT NECESSARY**) 
6) Arduino IDE installed in computer 
7) Coolterm software for reading the serial output and writing it in .txt file so that it can be converted to any format afterwards.
8) A lighter to test experiment

## About MQ2 gas sensor

The MQ-2 gas sensor is a widely used electronic device designed to detect various gases in the air. 
It is particularly sensitive to combustible gases like **methane, butane, propane, and alcohol vapors**.
But the Library for the MQ2 gas sensor is only programmed for detecting **LPG , CO (Carbon Monooxide) and SMOKE**.
